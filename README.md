# Appendicularia Project
Prediction of appendicular abundance as a function of environmental data.
This code explores data, performs principal component analyses, fits gradient boosting models to predict appendicular abundance, and evaluates the performance of the fitted models.

### **Description**
Net towns and CTD casts were performed around an oceanic island in the South Pacific. All records are considered independent. The abundance of plankton as well as several physical parameters of the environment were recorded.
- **Question : What are the main environmental factors affecting the abundance of Appendicularia? Do they have a strong influence?**
